# Load Data

Use the function:

```python
(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test) = loadData(dataType)
```

Select th right dataset.

```python
loadData('small') // for load small dataset
loadData('big') // for load big dataset
```

Don't use loadData('big') on local machine, you probably don't have enough memory.
